## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - utility-first CSS framework

### What I learned

First time using Tailwind CSS so I chose a simple project for practise. After a while I got the hand of it, so maybe I continue using it in the future more.

Other than that this project was no real challenge for me.

### Continued development



### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS docs](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Documentation for Tailwind CSS to look up all the needed classes
